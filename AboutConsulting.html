        <h2>Blockchain</h2>
        <p>A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>
        <p>The blockchain network has no central authority â€” it is the very definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see. Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is by its very nature transparent and everyone involved is accountable for their actions.</p>

        <h2>Autonomous Things (Robots)</h2>
        <p> Autonomous things, abbreviated AuT, or the Internet of autonomous things, abbreviated as IoAT, is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects. 
            <br><br>
        Self-navigating drones are the first AuT technology in (limited) deployment. It is expected that the first mass-deployment of AuT technologies will be the autonomous car, generally expected to be available around 2020. Other currently expected AuT technologies include home robotics (e.g., machines that provide care for the elderly, infirm or young), and military robots (air, land or sea autonomous machines with information-collection or target-attack capabilities). </p>

        <h2>Immersive Experience</h2>
        <p>An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it. The term is associated with technology environments that command the senses such as virtual reality and mixed reality. The following are illustrative examples of immersive experience.</p>
        Education
Pulling digital elements into the classroom with mixed reality or transforming the learning environment with virtual reality. For example, exploring the surface of Mars as part of a science lesson.
<br><br>
Art
Contemporary art that is designed to surround the visitor. Immersive experiences can be accomplished without technology as art can transform reality on its own.
<br><br>
Restaurants
Restaurants that simulate an unreal environment. For example, a restaurant designed to look like a ninja village complete with actors that draw visitors into a story.
<br><br>
Events
Events such as a concert designed to transform the venue such that it resembles a different reality.
<br><br>
Entertainment
Theme parks, movies and games that completely surround you. This includes pervasive games that draw virtual elements into the real world. In theory, movies could also occur in the real world.
<br><br>
Etc.
